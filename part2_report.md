# Part 2 Report

## Antonios
I created this report file and reviewed, approved, and merged pull requests created by teammates. Merging the .env fix was a real pain due to the web interface saying that it had to be merged via the command line, so I set up and familiarized myself with the GitHub CLI to manually merge the PR. I also caught and fixed some leftover player references after merging the namechange PR, removed the .env file from the repo after merging the change to .gitignore, and rewrote the commit history to try and remove mentions of the secret key.
