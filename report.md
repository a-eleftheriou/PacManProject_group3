# Group 3 Report

## Antonios
I forked the repo, added all group members as contributers, and generally managed the logistics of the group. I contributed to the repo by creating the game_board branch, which included 'implementing' game_board.py and writing tests for it (which I later found out were unneeded, but at that point I had already written them, so they stayed). I also created this report file for the repo and approved Joshua's pull request.
