# Group 3 Report

## Antonios
I forked the repo, added all group members as contributers, and generally managed the logistics of the group. I contributed to the repo by creating the game_board branch, which included 'implementing' game_board.py and writing tests for it (which I later found out were unneeded, but at that point I had already written them, so they stayed). I also created this report file for the repo and approved Joshua's pull request.

## Harleen
I helped form the team to kick off this project for all of us. I contributed to this repo by managing two merge requests, which consisted of reviewing line-by-line and sending forward approval comments. I also tested the game out for any bugs and identified 2 key issues that interfered with gameplay: (1) the score fails to increment after consuming dots/ghosts, (2) after 3 tries the game fails to restart. I also identified 2 UI issues that also hindered user's experiences: (1) the ghosts have a hard time navigating around the walls as they continuously follow the player, often getting stuck; (2) the dots that the player is supposed to consume are overlapping the walls.
